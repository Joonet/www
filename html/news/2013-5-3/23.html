          <div class=show><p>The Tablet PC is an intriguing new development in portable computing technology. This article describes the Tablet PC, gives some technical details, compares the Tablet PC to other forms of computer, provides an example of actual classroom use at the University of Illinois, and suggests further research on, and potential applications of, this technology in classroom instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Description of the Tablet PC<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tablet PC is a portable computing device which looks much like a detached screen from a conventional notebook computer, or perhaps a hand-held computer that&amp;apos;s been scaled up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a quasi-hybrid of laptop and palmtop computers, the Tablet PC owes much to those earlier technologies. However, one of the key advances that made the Tablet PC possible is the development of ultra-low power microprocessor chips by companies such as Transmeta and Intel. Another standard feature of the Tablet PC, handwriting recognition, first made its appearance in the Apple Newton palmtop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike a notebook (but like a palmtop) the normal way of entering data in a Tablet PC is with a stylus rather than a keyboard. While most models do offer keyboards (integrated in the so-called "convertible" models and separate in the so-called "slate" models), the Tablet PC is designed to use the stylus for most routine tasks. The Tablet PC generally offers some kind of handwriting recognition, and uses modified versions of popular applications that are designed for stylus input. The user interacts with the computer by drawing directly on the screen with the stylus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike a palmtop (but like a notebook), the Tablet PC features a full-sized color screen, an internal hard drive, and other features associated with a standard computer. This greatly enhances the use of a Tablet for public presentations. The moderately high resolution color screen is suited for use with a video projector, and the large amount of on-board storage (20-60 GB or more) means that even a complicated multimedia presentation can be loaded into a Tablet without the risk of running out of space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tablet PCs mostly work with graphical images ("ink" in Tablet jargon) rather than ASCII text. This is very convenient for creating with a stylus, but could pose problems if (e.g.) an "ink" document were emailed to someone on a slow dialup connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost all Tablet PCs either come with wireless networking built in, or can be upgraded to have that capability.&nbsp; Standard ports, such as USB and/or Firewire, are available on most models.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tablet PCs are priced similarly to high-end notebook computers. The machines are typically in the $2,000 to $3,000 price range, although there are a few low-end models around $1000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Tablet PC manufacturer, RM, has announced models aimed specifically at the academic market. An interesting feature of RM&amp;apos;s "instructor" model is built-in fingerprint identification. This might be useful for an instructor who needs to carry confidental information (grades, exams, research data, etc.) on the Tablet. RM also offers a "student" model. <br />
